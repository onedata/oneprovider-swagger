  summary: List space top datasets
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the list of space's top datasets - ones that do not have any parent
    dataset. In special case when dataset has been established for space root
    directory, there is only one top dataset.

    Datasets in each space are divided into two separate trees based on their states:
    * `attached` - this tree represents the hierarchy of datasets, which corresponds
      to the hierarchy of files in the space. It can be perceived as a "compressed"
      file tree, containing only the nodes corresponding to files/directories marked
      as a dataset. For example, dataset A is child of dataset B because
      B's root directory is ancestor to A's root file and no directory between
      them is a root of any attached dataset. Consequently, moving dataset's root file
      to other location may change the dataset location in the tree.

    * `detached` - this tree represents the hierarchy of datasets for the moment
      of detachment and does not change when root files are moved. Individual
      datasets from this tree can be reattached, causing the tree to be
      restructured in specific cases.
