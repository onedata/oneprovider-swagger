    This method subscribes through HTTP streaming on events of specific type
    for a given path.

    Until the connection is kept alive, the events will be streamed to
    subscribers as soon as they are occur. The optional `timeout` parameter can
    be used to automatically disconnect  when no events occur in a given time
    window.
