  summary: Download file content by ID
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the content of a file or directory specified by [$FILE_ID](#operation/lookup_file_id).

    If $FILE_ID is a regular file, returns its binary content. Partial content
    download is also supported using
    [Range header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range).

    If $FILE_ID is a directory, returns a TAR archive with its contents.
    Any nested files or subdirectories to which the client does not have access
    (e.g. due to insufficient POSIX permissions or ACLs) are omitted in the resulting archive.
    Request for directory download results in a redirection URL (in Location header) that
    contains the ID of a temporary download session. The URL can be used to download the
    tarball, with support for resuming interrupted downloads using the Range header
    (where the range start is the number of already downloaded bytes and the range end is omitted).

    ***Example cURL requests***

    **Download entire file content**
    ```bash
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
    -X GET "https://$PROVIDER_HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/data/$FILE_ID/content"

    abcdefghijklmno
    ```

    **Download only part of the file content**
    ```bash

    -X GET "https://$PROVIDER_HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/data/$FILE_ID/content" \
    -H "Range: bytes=5-8"

    fghi
    ```

    **Download a directory as tar archive**
    ```bash
    curl -sD - -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
    -X GET "https://$PROVIDER_HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/data/$DIR_ID/content" | grep location
    
    location: https://$PROVIDER_HOST/download/$DOWNLOAD_ID
    ```
    
    ```
    curl https://$PROVIDER_HOST/download/$DOWNLOAD_ID > directory.tar
    ```

    **Download a directory as tar archive in a single request**
    ```bash
    curl -L -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
    -X GET "https://$PROVIDER_HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/data/$DIR_ID/content"
    ```

    **Resume download of a directory (previous download failed after 12345678 bytes)**
    ```bash
    curl -H "Range: bytes=12345678-" https://$PROVIDER_HOST/download/$DOWNLOAD_ID >> directory.tar
    ```

    **Download a directory as tar archive in a single request without resolving symlinks**
    ```bash
    curl -L -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
    -X GET "https://$PROVIDER_HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/data/$DIR_ID/content?follow_symlinks=false"
    ```

    The `offset` query parameter can be used to start writing from a certain byte

    fragment will be preserved).
    If no `offset` query is given, the file is truncated and the previous file content
    is completely overwritten.
