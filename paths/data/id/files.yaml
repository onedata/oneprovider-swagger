  summary: List files recursively
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Recursively lists non-directory files (i.e regular files, symbolic links and hardlinks)
    in directory specified by [$DIR_ID](#operation/lookup_file_id) (listing root).
    Files are listed in lexicographical order by their paths, which are relative to the listing root directory.
    If there is no access to specified directory, its own relative path (`"."`) will be included in the
    `inaccessiblePaths` field and the listing result (i.e. `files` field) will be empty.
