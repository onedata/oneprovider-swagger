    Initializes process of purging an archive.
    The process may be time consuming therefore it is possible to pass callback URL
    on which the POST request will be performed to notify that the process has finished.
    The callback request will include JSON `{"archiveId": $ARCHIVE_ID}` as a body to determine which
    archive has been purged.

    This operation requires `space_manage_datasets` and 'space_remove_archives' privileges.
