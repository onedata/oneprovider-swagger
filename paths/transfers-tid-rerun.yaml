  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Reruns ended transfer by creating a new, identical transfer.

    This operation requires:
      * `space_schedule_replication` when rerunning replication
      * `space_schedule_eviction` when rerunning eviction
      * `space_schedule_replication` and `space_schedule_eviction` when rerunning migration

    Additionally, rerunning transfers using views requires `space_query_views` privilege.
