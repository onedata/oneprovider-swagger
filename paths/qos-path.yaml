    Returns QoS summary for file or directory specified by path. QoS summary
    contains information about effective QoS, which is calculated by merging
    QoS entries defined directly for file with QoS entries defined for all
    its parents. Effective QoS contains list of all QoS entries that influences
    given file or directory and mapping that maps storage Id to sublist of QoS
    entries. This mapping shows which QoS entries requires file replica on given
    storage (mapping is calculated by system using information stored in QoS entries).
