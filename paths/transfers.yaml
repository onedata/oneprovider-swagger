  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Creates transfer, which is a process of data movement between providers.
    This operation is asynchronous and it can take a long time depending on the
    size of the data to move.

    The following types of transfer are supported:
    - `replication` - process of copying data to achieve a complete replica in provider
      specified as `replicatingProviderId`. The data will be copied
      from one or more providers in the space that hold replicas
      or some fragments. This operation requires
      `space_schedule_replication` privilege.
    - `eviction` - process of removing replica(s) from provider specified in `evictingProviderId`.
      Eviction is safe - will succeed only if there is at least one
      complete replica (accumulated) on other providers in the space.
      This operation requires `space_schedule_eviction` privilege.
    - `migration` - `replication` followed by `eviction`. This operation requires both
      `space_schedule_replication` and `space_schedule_eviction` privileges.

    Each transfer applies to one or more files/directories, depending on chosen `dataSourceType`:
      - file - a single chosen file or directory
      - view - all files that are returned as a result of querying chosen view

    In case of a directory, the transfer applies to all its subfiles and subdirectories (recursively).

    ***Example cURL requests***

    **Create file replication**
    ```bash
    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" -X POST \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "type": "replication", "replicatingProviderId": $PROVIDER_ID, "dataSourceType": "file", "fileId": $FILE_ID }' \
    "https://$HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/transfers"
    ```
  consumes:
    - application/json
  produces:
    - application/json
  responses:
    '201':
      description: >
        The request has been accepted and the result is the transfer Id.
        Also URI of the transfer in form https://$HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/transfers/{id} is
        returned in the response `Location` header.
