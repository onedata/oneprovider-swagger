  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Creates transfer, which is a process of data movement between providers.
    This operation is asynchronous and it can take a long time depending on the
    size of the data to move.

    The following types of transfers are supported:
    - `replication` - process of copying data to provider specified in `replicatingProviderId`.
                      This operation requires `space_schedule_replication` privilege.
    - `eviction` - process of removing data from provider specified in `evictingProviderId`
                   but only if replicas of data exist on other providers.
                   This operation requires `space_schedule_eviction` privilege.
    - `migration` - `replication` preceded by `eviction`, which means that data will be first
                    copied to `replicatingProviderId` (it will choose best source to copy from,
                    which means it doesn't have to be `evictingProviderId`) and then removed
                    from `evictingProviderId`. This operation requires both
                    `space_schedule_replication` and `space_schedule_eviction` privileges.

    Data to be moved can come from any of the following:
    - file - depending on what is specified in `fileId` a single file or entire directory
             with all of its subfiles and subdirectories will be moved.
             In that case access to it is required.
    - view - files obtained by querying the view will be moved. In this case
             `space_query_views` privilege is additionally required.
             Also view must be defined on all providers involved in the process.

        The request has been accepted and the result is the transfer Id.
        Also URI of the Transfer in form https://$HOST/api/v3/oneprovider/transfers/{id} is
        returned in the response `Location` header.
