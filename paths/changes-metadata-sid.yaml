  summary: Subscribe to file events
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    This method subscribes through HTTP streaming on events of specific type
    for a given space.

    Until the connection is kept alive, the events will be streamed to
    subscribers as soon as they are occur. The optional `timeout` parameter
    can be used to automatically disconnect  when no events occur in a
    given time window.
