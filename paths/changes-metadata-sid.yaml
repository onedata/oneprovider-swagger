  summary: Subscribe to file events
  description: |
    This method subscribes through HTTP streaming on events of specific type for a given space.
    
    Until the connection is kept alive, the events will be streamed to subscribers as soon as they are occur. The optional `timeout` parameter can be used to automatically disconnect  when no events occur in a given time window.
  
    ***Example cURL requests***

    "https://$HOST:8443/api/v3/oneprovider/changes/metadata/MySpace1"
    ```
