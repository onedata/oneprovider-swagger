      Aggregate status of all effective QoS requirements that concern this file/directory. Possible statuses:
        * `fulfilled` - desired number of replicas have been created on matching storages and their contents are up-to-date.
        * `pending` - data replication is still ongoing.
        * `impossible` - there are not enough storage backends matching the expression to meet the required number of replicas.
