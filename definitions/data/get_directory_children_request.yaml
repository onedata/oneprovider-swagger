properties:
  limit:
    description: >
      Specifies the maximum number of entries that can be returned in one result batch.
      If there are more files, they can be retrieved using options that specify a custom starting point
      (`token`, `index`).
    type: integer
    maximum: 1000
    minimum: 1
    default: 1000

  token:
    description: >
      Determines the starting point for listing. The listing will start from the next page (batch) of entries
      which follows the page previously obtained along with the corresponding `nextPageToken`.
      Cannot be provided alongside the `index` or `tuneForLargeContinuousListing` parameters.
    type: string
    default: null

  # @TODO VFS-11412 make index only accept index from file attr
  index:
    description: >
      Determines the starting point for listing. The listing will (inclusively) start from the first
      file whose name is lexicographically greater or equal to the specified index.
      Cannot be provided alongside the `token` parameter.
    type: string

  offset:
    description: >
      Expressed in number of entries, further adjusts the starting point of listing indicated by the `index` 
      parameter (or the list beginning if the `index` is not specified).
      The value can be negative, in such case entries preceding the starting point will be returned.
      Cannot be provided alongside the `token` parameter.
    type: integer
    maximum: 500
    minimum: -500
    default: 0

  tuneForLargeContinuousListing:
    description: >
      This option increases performance of listing large directories (with thousands of files)
      when using subsequent calls with paging tokens.<br/>
      **CAUTION!!** When enabled, there is no guarantee that changes in the file tree performed
      after the start of listing will be included. Therefore it shouldn't be used when the
      listing result is expected to be up to date with the state of the file tree at the moment of listing.
      It should be avoided if the interval between subsequent listings is longer than 10 seconds,
      otherwise the listing performance will be much worse.<br/>
      Overusing this option may cause a significant load on the Oneprovider.<br/>
      Cannot be provided alongside the `token` parameter.
    type: boolean

  tune_for_large_continuous_listing:
    description: >
      (**DEPRECATED**) This parameter is still supported but scheduled for deletion in future releases.
      Use `tuneForLargeContinuousListing` instead.
