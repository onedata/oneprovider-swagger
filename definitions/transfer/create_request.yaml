      Requested type of transfer. Depending on selected type specifying also
      `replicatingProviderId`, `evictingProviderId` or both may be required.
    enum:
      - replication
      - eviction
      - migration
  replicatingProviderId:
    type: string
    description: >
      Id of provider to which data will be copied, ensuring that the provider
      has a complete replica at the end of the process.
      The data will be copied from one or more providers in the space that
      hold replicas or some fragments.
  evictingProviderId:
    type: string
    description: >
      Id of provider from which replica(s) are to be removed.
      Eviction is safe - will succeed only if there is at least one complete
      replica (accumulated) on other providers in the space.

    type: string
    description: >
      This parameter allows the user to specify a REST callback URL which will
      be called (http `POST` request with transfer Id in body) when the transfer
      is complete.
