      `type = "file"` - this transfer covers a single file or a whole directory
      (recursively). When scheduling such transfer, the user must have permissions to
      access the file/directory.
          
      `type = "view"` - this transfer covers files that are returned as a result of
      querying chosen view. The view must be defined on all providers involved in
      the process and querying it must return a valid list of file ids to be transferred.
      For more information about views, please see
      [here](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/replication_management.html#advanced-operations-using-views).
