description: Specification of file to be registered in the Onedata file-system.
properties:
  spaceId:
    type: string
    description: Id of the space in which the file will be registered.
  storageId:
    type: string
    description: >
      Id of the storage on which the file is located.
      Storage must be created as an `imported` storage with path type equal to `canonical`.
  storageFileId:
    type: string
    description: >
      Identifier of the file on storage, relevant for given storage backend:
         * path on POSIX-compatible or canonical object storages, e.g. `/dir/file.txt`
         * URL on HTTP based storages, e.g. `https://www.example.org/data/21/run123.tar`
  destinationPath:
    type: string
    description: An absolute path in space where file should be created.
  size:
    type: integer
    description: >
      Size of the file in bytes. If not passed, it will be acquired from storage.
      If storage does not support the `stat` operation or equivalent used for acquiring files metadata,
      registration will fail if this value is missing.
  mode:
    type: string
    description: >
      User defined POSIX file permissions in octal format. If not passed, it will be acquired from storage or default
      `"664"` mode will be used.
  atime:
    type: integer
    description: >
      User defined last access timestamp (in seconds).
      If not passed, it will be acquired from storage or current timestamp will be used.
  mtime:
    type: integer
    description: >
      User defined last modification timestamp (in seconds).
      If not passed, it will be acquired from storage or current timestamp will be used.
  ctime:
    type: integer
    description: >
      User defined last attributes modification timestamp (in seconds).
      If not passed, it will be acquired from storage or current timestamp will be used.
  uid:
    type: string
    description: >
      User defined of the Id of the owner of this file on storage.
      If not passed, it will be acquired from storage or `0` will be used.
      This value will be mapped, using LUMA DB, to acquire Onedata user Id of the file owner.
  gid:
    type: string
    description: >
      User defined Id of the group owner of this file on storage.
      If not passed, it will be acquired from storage or `0` will be used.
      This value will be used as display GID in `getattr` operation.

    additionalProperties:
      type: string
  autoDetectAttributes:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Flag which determines whether additional `stat` operation (or equivalent) should be performed
      on the storage to automatically detect file attributes - they will be used if not provided
      explicitly in the request. The detection also ensures that the file exists - it is performed
      if the flag is set to `true`, even if all attributes are provided.

      If this flag is set to `false`, default attributes are used if not provided explicitly.
      The only exception is the `size` attribute, which is mandatory. The registration request will
      fail if `autoDetectAttributes` is set to `false` and `size` is not provided.

      It is possible to register a file that does not exist on storage if `autoDetectAttributes` is
      set to `false`. Such file will be visible in Onedata but not accessible.
