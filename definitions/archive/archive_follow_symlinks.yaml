  <!--- TODO VFS-7616 refine archive params and their description-->
  This flag determines whether symbolic links **pointing to paths outside of the dataset**
  should be resolved during archive creation. 

  If set to `true`, valid links will be resolved and their target files/directories will be 
  copied to the archive in their place. Invalid symbolic links (not resolvable to a valid path
  in the space) will be ignored and not included in the archive.

  If set to `false`, symbolic links will be copied to the resulting archive and their target
  paths will not be modified. Note that these symbolic links may target modifiable files in the space.

  **NOTE**: Symbolic links pointing to files inside the dataset are always preserved, 
  regardless of this setting. Their target paths are reconstructed to point to the 
  corresponding files in the resulting archive.
default: true
example: false
