  <!--- TODO VFS-7616 refine archive params and their description-->
  This flag determines whether symbolic links in a dataset should be resolved.
  If set to true all symbolic links targeting outside of dataset will be resolved, 
  targeting files in dataset will target appropriate files in created archive 
  and invalid symbolic links will be ignored.
  If set to false all symbolic links targeting files in dataset will target appropriate 
  files in created archive and all other symbolic links will be left intact (they may target 
  files in file system that can be modified).
default: true
example: false
