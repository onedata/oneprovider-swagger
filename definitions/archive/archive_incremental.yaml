  <!--- TODO VFS-7616 refine archive params and their description-->
  This flag determines whether archive is incremental - storing only files that have
  changed since the previous archivization of the dataset.
  Unchanged files are preserved as hard links to the corresponding files in the previous archive.
  If set to `false`, all files belonging to the dataset are stored directly in the archive.

  WARNING: Currently only `false` value of this option is supported.
default: false
