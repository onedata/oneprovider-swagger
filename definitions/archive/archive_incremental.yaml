  This flag determines whether archive is incremental - storing only files that have
  changed in comparison to the base archive (consult description of the `baseArchiveId` parameter).
  Unchanged files are preserved as hard links to the corresponding files in the base archive.
  If set to `false`, all files belonging to the dataset are stored directly in the archive.
default: false
