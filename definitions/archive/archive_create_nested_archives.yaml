  <!--- TODO VFS-7616 refine archive params and their description-->
  This flag determines the strategy of archiving nested datasets (i. e. datasets inside the dataset that is being archived).

  If set to `true`, a separate archive will be created for each nested dataset, and a symbolic link to the nested archive will
  be created in the parent archive in the place of the nested dataset's root file/directory. The procedure is recursive and
  may effectively create a tree of linked archives.

  If set to `false`, the resulting archive will be monolithic, i. e. all files and directories from nested datasets will be copied
  directly to the archive, in their respective locations. Effectively, the internal hierarchy of datasets has no impact on the
  resulting archive content.
