  Dataset protection flags:

  * `data_protection` - causes all dataset's files and directories to be
     protected from modifying their content.

  * `metadata_protection` - causes all dataset's files and directories to be
     protected from modifying their metadata (custom metadata, ACL, etc.).

  Requests to modify the data/metadata when protection is enabled will be rejected
  with the EPERM POSIX error.

  The protection flags are ignored when the dataset is in `detached` state.

  Changing the protection flags may not have an immediate effect,
  especially for files that were already opened before the change.

  Note however that some basic readonly file attributes (such as e.g. `atime`
  updated when a file is read) will be modified regardless.
