  Dataset protection flags:

  * `data_protection` - causes all dataset's files and directories to be
     protected from modifying their content.

  * `metadata_protection` - causes all dataset's files and directories to be
     protected from modifying their metadata (custom metadata, ACL, etc.).

  Attempts to change the data/metadata when protection is enabled and the dataset
  is in `attached` state will be denied with the EPERM POSIX error (with exception
  to already opened files).

  Note however that some basic readonly file attributes (such as e.g. `atime`
  updated when a file is read) will be modified regardless.
items:
  type: string
  enum:
    - data_protection
    - metadata_protection
example: ["data_protection"]
