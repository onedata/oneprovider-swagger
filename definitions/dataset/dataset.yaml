      Once the dataset has been established the root file can no longer be changed.
      Even after detaching dataset it can be reattached only to the same file
      and only if it still exists.

    $ref: '#/definitions/FileType'
  rootFilePath:
    type: string
    description: >
      Path to the file or directory in the virtual file system.
      For datasets in `detached` state this field is frozen and shows the value
      it had at the time of detaching. It is done for archival purposes as file
      may have been renamed or removed.
