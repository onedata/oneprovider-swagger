  The state of the dataset:

  * `attached` - dataset is coupled with it's root file meaning it will be
    effectively treated as dataset and have additional features/constraints
    resulting from this (e.g. protection flags).

  * `detached` - dataset is decoupled with it's root file and serves only archival
    purposes. That means that dataset root file is no longer treated specially,
    and changes to it are not tracked by the dataset. In fact the file may have
    been renamed or removed but information about it, shown by the dataset, will
    reflect those recorded at the time of detaching. Dataset can be reattached
    again but only to the same file and only if it still exists (once dataset
    have been established the root file can no longer be changed).
enum:
  - attached
