  The state of the dataset:

  * `attached` - the dataset is coupled with its root file/directory, which means
    that the file/directory is treated as a dataset and offers some additional
    features (e.g. protection flags). The root file/directory contents are directly
    the dataset contents.

  * `detached` - the dataset is decoupled from its root file/directory and serves only archival
    purposes. The dataset does not correspond to any physical content in the file tree and
    changes to the original root file/directory contents are not reflected in the dataset.
    <!--- TODO VFS-7304
    The only purpose of detached datasets it so keep track of its archives that were created
    during its `attached` lifecycle.
    -->
    A `detached` dataset can be reattached, but only to the
    original file/directory and only if it still exists. Once a dataset has been established,
    its root file/directory can no longer be changed.
