description: |
 This is the RESTful API definition of Oneprovider component of Onedata data management system [http://www.onedata.org].

 This API provides methods for file management using REST protocol.

 All paths below are relative to a common Oneprovider basepath which is `/api/v3/oneprovider`, thus a complete example
 query for 'mode' file attributes would be:
  ```
  https://ONEPROVIDER_HOSTNAME/api/v3/oneprovider/attributes/Space1/directory1/file1.txt?attribute=mode
  ```
 Please note that currently the default port for Oneprovider instances is `8443`.
 ## Authentication
 In order to be able to use this API the REST client must be able to authenticate with the Oneprovider service.

 Currently this is supported through authentication token which can be generate using the Onedata user interface. 
 The token must be added to the request header like this:
  ```
  macaroon: LAKSJHDLKJAHSDKLJHASKLCBBASKLCBLHABSCBALKSBCK...
  ```

 In addition please take into account, that depending on your account authorization rights, not all operations
 may be possible.

 ## API structure
 The Oneprovider API reflects the fact that most operations deal directly with virtual file paths relative to
 user spaces, which are provided as part of the paths in the REST calls.

 The API provides the following functionality:

 ### Data
 
 #### File attributes
 The `/attributes/` operation group provides GET and PUT methods enable querying
 for file attributes, such as 'mode' file permissions and updating them.

 #### File browser
 The `/files/` path methods provide basic capability for browsing files in spaces and folders.
 Currently no wildcards are possible, thus paths must be complete up to a folder whose
 contents are needed and start with the name of the space containing the requested folders and files.

 #### Space information
 For convenience, `/space/` methods provider means for getting basic information about
 spaces directly from the Oneprovider service. For more comprehensive operations
 on spaces please use the Onezone API.

 ### Replication

 #### Replica management
 The `/replicas/` methods allow retrieving of information about file replica distribution
 among Onedata providers as well as requesting specific file replication to selected
 providers.

 #### Transfer management
 The `/transfer/` provides basic transfer management functionality based on the ID of transfer
 returned by `/replicas/{path} [POST]` operation. 
 
 ### Monitoring

 #### Changes subscription
 The `/changes/` method group provides means for subscribing (through HTTP long-polling technique) for
 file related events such as reads, writes or deletes which are returned as complete file metadata
 records with sequence numbers representing their current version.

 #### Monitoring metrics
 The `/metrics/` operations enable retrieval of internal Oneprovider monitoring data.
 All monitoring data is returned in the form of [RRD](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) 
 database files, with resolution determined by the `step` query parameter.
