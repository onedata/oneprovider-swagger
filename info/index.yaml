  # Overview

  This is the RESTful API definition of Oneprovider component of Onedata data management system [onedata.org](http://www.onedata.org).

  > This API is defined using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), the JSON specification can be used to automatically generate
  > client libraries - [swagger.json](../../../swagger/oneprovider/swagger.json).

  All paths below are relative to a common Oneprovider basepath which is `/api/v3/oneprovider`, thus a complete example
  query for 'mode' file attributes would be:
  ```
  https://ONEPROVIDER_HOSTNAME/api/v3/oneprovider/attributes/Space1/directory1/file1.txt?attribute=mode
  ```
  Please note that currently the default port for Oneprovider instances is `8443`.

  In addition to REST API, Oneprovider also provides support for [CDMI](../../cdmi.html) protocol,
  and some of data management operations are currently only possible via CDMI.


  ## Authentication
  In order to be able to use this API the REST client must be able to authenticate with the Oneprovider service.

  Currently this is supported through authentication token which can be generate using the Onedata user interface.
  The token must be added to the request header like this:
  ```
  X-Auth-Token: LAKSJHDLKJAHSDKLJHASKLCBBASKLCBLHABSCBALKSBCK...
  ```
  In case this Onedata deployment supports authentication delegation other IdP's,
  the `X-Auth-Token` field can contain token from such IdP with appropriate prefix,
  as configured by Onezone administrators, e.g.:
  ```
    X-Auth-Token: github:GST5aasdA7asdAASFG7asdasaAS
  ```
  In addition please take into account, that depending on your account authorization rights, not all operations
  may be possible.

  ## API structure
  The Oneprovider API reflects the fact that most operations deal directly with virtual file paths relative to
  user spaces, which are provided as part of the paths in the REST calls.

  The API provides the following functionality:

  ### Data

  #### File attributes
  The `/attributes/` operation group provides GET and PUT methods enable querying
  for file attributes, such as 'mode' file permissions and updating them.

  #### File browser
  The `/files/` path methods provide basic capability for browsing files in spaces and folders.
  Currently no wildcards are possible, thus paths must be complete up to a folder whose
  contents are needed and start with the name of the space containing the requested folders and files.

  #### Space information
  For convenience, `/space/` methods provider means for getting basic information about
  spaces directly from the Oneprovider service. For more comprehensive operations
  on spaces please use the Onezone API.

  #### Metadata
  Oneprovider exposes an advanced metadata management mechanism allowing to attach
  arbitrary JSON or RDF documents to any files or folders (under `/metata` path)
  as well as create indexes (`/index`) and query them based on the metadata (`/query-index`).

  ### Replication

  #### Replica management
  The `/replicas/` methods allow retrieving of information about file replica distribution
  among Onedata providers as well as requesting specific file replication to selected
  providers.

  #### Transfer management
  The `/transfer/` operations provide basic transfer management functionality based on the ID of transfer
  returned by `/replicas/{path} [POST]` operation.

  ### Monitoring

  #### Changes subscription
  The `/changes/` method group provides means for subscribing (through HTTP long-polling technique) for
  file related events such as reads, writes or deletes which are returned as complete file metadata
  records with sequence numbers representing their current version.

  #### Monitoring metrics
  The `/metrics/` operations enable retrieval of internal Oneprovider monitoring data.
  All monitoring data is returned in the form of [RRD](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/)
  database files, with resolution determined by the `step` query parameter.

  ## Examples

  **Create replica of file at specific storage provider**
  ```bash
  curl -v --tlsv1.2 -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" -X POST \
  "https://$PROVIDER:8443/api/v3/oneprovider/replicas/MySpace1/MyFile2.txt?provider_id=ASDNKJASF"
  ```

  **Get space storage qouta metric**
  ```bash
  curl -v --tlsv1.2 -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" -X GET \
  "https://$PROVIDER:8443/api/v3/oneprovider/metrics/space/MySpace1?metric=storage_qouta"
  ```

  More detailed examples are available in the documentation of each operation.
